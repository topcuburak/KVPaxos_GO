## Project Overview
A fault-tolerant key-value store on top of Paxos. 
The key-value store includes three kinds of operations: **Put**, **Get**, and **Append**.
Append performs the same as Put when the key is not in the store. Otherwise, it appends new value to the existing value. For example,

1. Put('k', 'a')  // so put here replaces an entry with a specific key 
2. Append('k', 'bc')   // while append adds a new item which is not existing
3. Get(k) -> 'abc'

Clients send Put(), Append(), and Get() RPCs to kvpaxos servers. A client can send an RPC to any of the kvpaxos servers, and should retry by sending to a different server if there's a failure. Each kvpaxos server contains a replica of the key/value database; handlers for client Get() and Put()/Append() RPCs; and a Paxos peer. Paxos takes the form of a library that is included in each kvpaxos server. A kvpaxos server talks to its local Paxos peer (**via method calls**). All kvpaxos replicas should stay identical; the only exception is that some replicas may lag others if they are not reachable. If a replica isn't reachable for a while, but then starts being reachable, it should eventually catch up (learn about operations that it missed).
